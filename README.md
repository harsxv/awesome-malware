# Malware Bucket

In my journey of system administrator, sometimes I dealt with malicious files.
I stored them in vaults, and destroy it. 

But, I thaught it might be interesting if I can make it public and maybe someone need them to do malware analysis.

## This repository contains malware from various extensions.
- PHP;
- Perl;
- Python;
- Bash;
- Binary;
- etc.

Feel free to share your malware finding.
